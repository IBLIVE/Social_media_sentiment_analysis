As to the latter, that can't be fixed in the short term. In the short term, #Harris and the #Democrats need to keep bringing up the things the media should be reporting on.  Not because it'll make them start reporting on it.

You can't even get a majority to agree if it should be called/labeled a genocide or not.Yeah, I've seen those polls which are laughable and ridiculous.  It tries to form a consensus but just winds up asking vague questions which lead respondents.  You will get the same result just by asking, \"Are you for war or against war\".Ask stupid questions, get stupid answers. Sure, everybody wants a ceasefire. But nobody agrees on what that means.  Does it require the release of hostages?  Many on the progressive left, still being a minority, try to claim the rest of the Democratic base as being on their side.  But it's much more complicated than that. The Democratic party is very split on Gaza. There is no majority.  And it would be stupid for the Harris campaign to appease one wing and risk losing her base or the independents she needs to win.I'm sure those on the progressive left want to treat this like Vietnam, but it is not the same thing. And the rest of the Democratic base understands that it's not the same as American troops actually doing the fighting, killing and dying.",

France has called for an arms embargo, as has Spain I believe, but I don\u2019t see any politician in the US joining their call. Why should, for example, someone who\u2019s sibling was killed from one of our bombs, listen to either party when both support policies that mean death for their loved ones?",

Pero tambi\u00e9n lo es que la nueva presidenta de M\u00e9xico\u00a0sentenci\u00f3 a muerte\u00a0a la actual Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Naci\u00f3n.En su primer discurso a la naci\u00f3n, la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo confirm\u00f3 que se aplicar\u00e1 la reforma judicial dise\u00f1ada por su antecesor Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.Lo anterior quiere decir simple y llanamente que el poder judicial ser\u00e1 sometido a los dictados de la Cuarta Transformaci\u00f3n, la cual decidir\u00e1 qui\u00e9nes ganar\u00e1n las elecciones de jueces, magistrados y ministros. Tambi\u00e9n, qui\u00e9nes ser\u00e1n los cinco integrantes del comit\u00e9 disciplinario que se encargar\u00e1 de evitar que los impartidores de justicia fallen en contra de los intereses del gobierno y de la 4T.De manera contradictoria, asegur\u00f3 certeza a los inversionistas nacionales y, sobre todo, extranjeros, en el proceso de relocalizaci\u00f3n de empresas (nearshoring). \u00bfEso que quiere decir? Que \u2500como lo hizo Obreg\u00f3n en 1923, con los Tratados de Bucareli\u2500 la reforma judicial ser\u00e1 indulgente con los inversionistas extranjeros.Obreg\u00f3n dej\u00f3 sin efecto la aplicaci\u00f3n de las leyes mexicanas a los latifundistas y a los petroleros estadounidenses a cambio del reconocimiento de la Casa Blanca.Un indicio de que es muy probable que la nueva presidenta de M\u00e9xico trate de tener grato al poder pol\u00edtico y econ\u00f3mico de los Estados Unidos es que mantendr\u00e1 la autonom\u00eda del Banco de M\u00e9xico (por lo menos, al inicio de su gobierno).Evento social m\u00e1s que pol\u00edtico.La ceremonia de toma de posesi\u00f3n se convirti\u00f3 en realidad en un evento social, los legisladores de la 4T (diputados y senadores) hicieron todo lo posible para tomarse la foto con la festejada (como, por ejemplo, en las fiestas de quince a\u00f1os).La euforia de los legisladores de la 4T evidenci\u00f3 su subordinaci\u00f3n a la nueva presidenta de la Rep\u00fablica. No hay en los hechos, Poder Legislativo.Y pronto, tampoco habr\u00e1 Poder Judicial.As\u00ed, aunque la presidenta Sheinbaum haya dicho que su antecesor Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador se retirar\u00e1 a escribir, lo cierto es que la dictadura est\u00e1 a punto de consolidarse.* Periodista y acad\u00e9mico universitario | @JorgeSantaCruz1Columna anterior: La verdadera tragedia de M\u00e9xico y Espa\u00f1a(El presente art\u00edculo se public\u00f3 de manera original en Sin Compromisos).El periodista Jorge Santa Cruz \u00a1Con\u00e9ctate con Sociedad Noticias!

        "content": "Donald Trump has always been for sale. It used to be shocking how many people were willing to prop him up in the hopes of profiting off his increasingly seamy ventures. But thanks to a morally bankrupt Republican Party and our degraded corporate media, Donald remains alarmingly close to the kind of power that\u2019s worth shelling out massive amounts of money to be close to\u2014and benefit from.Any person or entity, from Putin to Saudi Arabia\u2019s LIV Golf, willing to throw Donald a few bucks for a licensing fee or a Trump Tower condo has gained access and influence. Given this decades-long pattern, it\u2019s not surprising that the world\u2019s richest fascist -- South African jumping bean Elon Musk -- would also be interested in purchasing a few shares in a man who is willing to sell whatever he can get his hands on\u2014whether it\u2019s steaks or American national security\u2014because he values money more than anything. In exchange for Donald\u2019s willingness to throw Musk the keys to the federal government, Musk is throwing a considerable fortune, as well as the weight of Twitter\u2019s influence, behind the Republican candidate. For him, it\u2019s a safe bet because he knows, if Donald is elected, he\u2019ll do anything Musk wants him to do. It is, of course, a devil\u2019s bargain that continues to be made by others, including the aforementioned Vladimir Putin. The New York Times reported Friday that Musk and Donald speak regularly. Musk has spent at least $140 million on America PAC, a political action committee that supports Donald. Donald has told several people that this amount could balloon to as much as $500 million. According to the Times, Musk, a man with tremendous reach and influence simply by virtue of the fact that he has acquired an obscene amount of wealth, is \u201call in\u201d with Donald now: Ensconced in a war room in Pittsburgh with a team of lawyers, public-relations professionals, canvassing experts and longtime friends, Mr. Musk is trying to apply strategies and entrepreneurial lessons from his businesses to a grind-it-out political mission with just weeks to go until Election Day. It may be impossible to capture the financial value of all the support Mr. Musk is providing to Mr. Trump. This is in part because of his role on X, where he amplifies so much of the former president\u2019s message. As Benjamin Soskis, a historian of the ultrarich, told the Times, \u201cI\u2019m not sure there is a precedent in modern history to how Musk has inserted himself into a presidential race.\u201d #DonaldTrump #ElonMusk #PoliticalInfluence #RepublicanParty #CorporateMedia #Fascism #PoliticalActionCommittee #ElectionDay #WealthAndPower #DevilsBargain",

It is the ruthless pursuit of world domination, in short imperialism. Like all imperialism it is done, so that the lucky few in the United States don't lose a few cents on the dollar. It doesn't benefit the working class and it barely benefits the petite bourgeoisie. Freedom for the Palestinians means dismantling, as Roy says, the whole infrastructure of imperialism. Western leftists need to unflinchingly look at their own ruling class and realise that they are monsters.
