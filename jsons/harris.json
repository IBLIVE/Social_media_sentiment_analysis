You can't even get a majority to agree if it should be called/labeled a genocide or not.Yeah, I've seen those polls which are laughable and ridiculous.  It tries to form a consensus but just winds up asking vague questions which lead respondents.  You will get the same result just by asking, \"Are you for war or against war\".Ask stupid questions, get stupid answers. Sure, everybody wants a ceasefire. But nobody agrees on what that means.  Does it require the release of hostages?  Many on the progressive left, still being a minority, try to claim the rest of the Democratic base as being on their side.  But it's much more complicated than that. The Democratic party is very split on Gaza. There is no majority.  And it would be stupid for the Harris campaign to appease one wing and risk losing her base or the independents she needs to win.I'm sure those on the progressive left want to treat this like Vietnam, but it is not the same thing. And the rest of the Democratic base understands that it's not the same as American troops actually doing the fighting, killing and dying.",

Implementing a shift in a decades-long agreement in response to an allied nation's actions would be doing /exactly/ that.Now who wants the US to behave like it's old superpower self?  Aren't we done with US world domination?Diplomats are working around the clock, under the Biden administration, to step back US influence AND stop the horror.Netanyahu's administration is the problem.  They are not pawns.",

The distributions are very spiky, not a nice normal curve. When I added the first probabilistic views in 2016, I thought about showing the actual distributions from the simulations, but it was very noisy and harder to interpret, so I ended up just showing the bounds of the middle 68%-95%-99.7% portions of the distributions instead.",

While, at the same time, refusing to support the victims of such policies with anything more than the barest of lip service.I have no words to convince such people that their lives will improve meaningfully, no matter who they vote for.
