There\u2019s no way to compromise with #KamalaHarris on this. Instead of blaming #JillStein for appealing to voters who are actually not interested in a genocidal former prosecutor anyway, Democrats should focus on their own policy agenda and bad choices.

It doesn't benefit the working class and it barely benefits the petite bourgeoisie. Freedom for the Palestinians means dismantling, as Roy says, the whole infrastructure of imperialism.
